## Introduction

This project contains comprehensive research reports and analyses of selected stocks in my investment portfolio. Each report is crafted using LaTeX templates designed for both in-depth analysis and initial stock screening. The repository serves as a record of my investment decisions and a tool for continuous learning and improvement.

## Investment Philosophy

My investment approach is grounded in **long-term value investing**, focusing on:

- Identifying companies with **strong fundamentals** and sustainable competitive advantages.
- Conducting thorough **intrinsic valuation** to find undervalued stocks.
- Maintaining a **concentrated portfolio** to capitalize on high-conviction ideas.
- Emphasizing **risk management** by understanding potential downsides.

## Templates

This repository also includes LaTeX templates designed for investment research:

- **Comprehensive Analysis Template**: For detailed research and valuation of individual stocks.
- **Initial Research Template**: For quick assessment of stocks during the screening process.

Templates are located in the `templates` directory:

- [Comprehensive Analysis Template](templates/comprehensive_analysis_template.tex)
- [Initial Research Template](templates/initial_research_template.tex)
